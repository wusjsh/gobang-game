### Game introduction
Gobang, also called Gomoku, or Five in a Row, is an abstract strategy board game. It is traditionally played with Go pieces (black and white stones) on a Go board. Because pieces are typically not moved or removed from the board, Gobang may also be played as a paper-and-pencil game. The game is known in several countries under different names.
