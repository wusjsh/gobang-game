        <div class="info">
        Gobang, also called Gomoku, or Five in a Row, is an abstract strategy board game. 
        It is traditionally played with Go pieces (black and white stones) on a Go board.
        Because pieces are typically not moved or removed from the board, Gobang may also 
        be played as a paper-and-pencil game. The game is known in several countries under 
        different names.

        <h2>Win Rule</h2>
        <div class="info">
        Players alternate turns placing a stone of their color on an empty intersection. 
        The winner is the first player to form an unbroken chain of five stones horizontally, 
        vertically, or diagonally.
